# ANN_from_Scratch

Here we try to invoke the Neural Network but not using some pre-trained model such as Tensorflow, Keras or Pytorch.

We create a brand new Deep Learning Neural Network model say Braniac (let) (after the Super intelligent Villain Robot in Superman:The Animated Series)

Let's start and ennd with a classic OOP model
